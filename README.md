> A small application for serving media managed with
> [hydrus server][hydrus-server] via API

hydrusrv is a small application based on [Express][express] that can serve
media managed with [hydrus server][hydrus-server] over a REST-like API. A
separate application called [hydrusrv-sync][hydrusrv-sync] is used to access
the databases of hydrus server and copy over the data into hydrusrv's content
database.

hydrusrv provides its own (simple) user handling and token-based
authentication (stored in a separate database) instead of relying on hydrus
server's access keys.

A [Vue][vue]-based Web client for hydrusrv called [hydrusrvue][hydrusrvue] is
also available.

## Install

The easiest way to install is via cloning this repository:

```zsh
user@local:~$ git clone https://github.com/mserajnik/hydrusrv.git
user@local:~$ cd hydrusrv
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn
```

If you encounter any errors during installation, those are likely caused by
packages hydrusrv uses that utilize native bindings (e.g.,
[better-sqlite3][better-sqlite3] and [phc-argon2][phc-argon2]).

Please check the error message and contact the maintainers of those packages
directly if you cannnot resolve your issues.

### Dependencies

+ [hydrusrv-sync][hydrusrv-sync] (`3.x` for hydrusrv `6.x`)
+ [Node.js][node-js]
+ [Yarn][yarn]

I usually use the latest versions of Node.js and Yarn; if there has not been an
update to this repository in a while and something breaks on the latest
Node/Yarn version, please [let me know][issues].

### Updating

If you have installed via cloning the repository, you can update via Git:

```zsh
user@local:hydrusrv$ git pull
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn migrate
```

Always make sure to run `yarn` after updating to install any packages you might
be missing. `yarn migrate` updates your authentication database with the latest 
changes.

hydrusrv follows [semantic versioning][semantic-versioning] and any breaking
changes that require additional attention will be released under a new major
version (e.g., `2.0.0`). Minor version updates (e.g., `1.1.0` or `1.2.0`) are
therefore always safe to simply install via the routine mentioned before.

When necessary, this section will be expanded with upgrade guides to new major
versions.

#### Upgrading from 5.x to 6.x

Upgrading from `5.x` to `6.x` can be done via `git pull && yarn`.

If you are using hydrusrv-sync and hydrusrvue, you will need to update those to
`3.x` to maintain compatibility with hydrusrv `6.x`.

#### Upgrading from 4.x to 5.x

Upgrading from `4.x` to `5.x` can be done via `git pull && yarn` and requires
only a few setting changes and considerations.

The only major change is the addition of counts when listing files and tags,
requiring some API changes as well as the addition of two new tables to the
content database.

If you are using hydrusrv-sync and hydrusrvue, you will need to update those to
`2.x` to maintain compatibility with hydrusrv `5.x`.

#### Upgrading from 3.x to 4.x

Upgrading from `3.x` to `4.x` can be done via `git pull && yarn`, but requires
some additional work and considerations.

Starting with `4.0.0`, hydrusrv no longer copies the hydrus server data over by
itself, but relies on a separate application called
[hydrusrv-sync][hydrusrv-sync] to do so.

This change was mainly made to increase performance. Before, hydrusrv would
hold all the copied data in-memory, only allowing for a single thread to access
it. Due to the SQLite library that's being used only featuring a synchronous
API, a single request or a sync task could block the whole API.

With `4.x`, hydrusrv-sync persists the data and hydrusrv accesses it using
multiple workers (by default, one for every logical CPU core, but that is
configurable), multiplying the possible requests per seconds since a single
requests will only block a single worker for a very short period.

In addition, hydrusrv now uses two databases â€“ the authentication database and
the content database. While the authentication database is basically what the
old app database was and is still managed completely by hydrusrv itself using
migrations, the content database holds the hydrus server data and is managed by
hydrusrv-sync, hydrusrv itself only reads from it.

Therefore, you have to install hydrusrv-sync and either run it manually every
time you want to sync the data from hydrus server or set up a cron job
(recommended).

Renaming the old `app.db` to `authentication.db` should work so you do not have
to migrate the users manually.

As a last step, take a look at the changed environment variables and adjust
accordingly.

#### Upgrading from 2.x to 3.x

Upgrading from `2.x` to `3.x` can be done via `git pull && yarn`, but requires
some additional work and considerations.

First of all, the app database structure has changed, with the table `tokens`
having a new column `media_hash`. You need to either re-create your database
from the template or add this column to your existing database manually.

It is __strongly recommended__ to re-create the database by copying the
template and running migrations (`yarn migrate`). This will ensure that any
future changes will just require running migrations instead of making manual
adjustments or starting over with an empty database.

Second, accessing media files now requires media tokens that are generated
alongside authentication tokens and expire together with them. Such a media
token must be provided as a query parameter in the form `?token=<media token>`
for every media file request.

#### Upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

Upgrading from `1.x` to `2.x` can be done via `git pull && yarn` and requires
only a few setting changes and considerations.

The main difference between `2.x` and `1.x` is that `2.x` uses a temporary copy
of the hydrus server data in its own application database instead of directly
querying the hydrus server database on demand for increased performance and
better extensibility.

The setting `HYDRUS_RESULTS_PER_PAGE` has therefore been renamed to just
`RESULTS_PER_PAGE` while a new setting called `DATA_UPDATE_INTERVAL` controls
how often hydrusrv should sync the temporary data with hydrus server (after the
initial sync when it starts).

This change now allows for sorting by an arbitrary number of namespaces instead
of just one while at the same time no longer limiting the result set by the
provided sort namespaces (which was an unfortunate side effect that was
unavoidable in `1.x` without killing the performance).

## Usage

### Configuration

After installing, the first thing you want to do is duplicating both the
authentication database template and the content database template you can find
under `storage/authentication.db.template` and `storage/content.db.template`.
These [SQLite][sqlite] databases are used to store both the users and tokens
for authentication, as well as a copy of the hydrus server data in an optimized
form (for faster on-demand querying).

The default (and recommended) location of the databases is
`storage/authentication.db` and `storage/content.db`, but you are free to put
them wherever you want and can rename them to your liking.

Next, you also need to duplicate `.env.example` to `.env`. This file is used to
configure hydrusrv and needs to be located in the root directory of the
application.

After copying it, you can edit `.env` and change hydrusrv's configuration. The
following are all the available settings (along with their default values):

+ `NODE_ENV=development`: defines the environment hydrusrv is running in.
  It currently does not affect anything besides the access logging but it
  should be set to `production` in a live environment and `development` when
  developing.
+ `URL=https://example.com`: the URL under which hydrusrv is accessible. Used
  to generate media URLs. __No trailing slashes.__
+ `PORT=8000`: the port hydrusrv is listening on. This can be different than
  the port used to access it from outside when proxying via [nginx][nginx]
  (recommended) or similar solutions.
+ `API_BASE=/api`: the base path of all the API routes. __No trailing__
  __slashes.__
+ `MEDIA_BASE=/media`: the base path of all the media routes. __No trailing__
  __slashes.__
+ `CROSS_ORIGIN_ALLOWED=false`: allows cross-origin requests (useful when the
  application accessing the API is located on a different domain).
+ `AUTHENTICATION_DB_PATH=./storage/authentication.db`: the authentication
  database path (absolute or relative). The database must exist and the file
  must be read-/writeable for hydrusrv.
+ `CONTENT_DB_PATH=./storage/content.db`: the content database path (absolute
  or relative). The database must exist and the file must be read-/writeable
  for hydrusrv.
+ `HYDRUS_FILES_PATH=`: sets the path to the hydrus server files directory
  (called `server_files`).  __Absolute path required.__
+ `NUMBER_OF_WORKERS=`: sets the number of workers. By default, one worker per
  logical CPU core is used. You might want to decrease or increase that number,
  depending on your needs/hardware. In general, the more workers are running,
  the more requests can be handled simultaneously. But note that increasing the
  number of workers beyond the number of logical CPUs might be detrimental to
  performance or cause even more serious issues (e.g., crashes).
+ `DB_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=3600`: sets the interval (in seconds) at which
  hydrusrv [checkpoints][checkpoint] the authentication database (the content
  database is handled by hydrusrv-sync).
+ `REGISTRATION_ENABLED=true`: setting this to `false` disables the creation of
  new users.
+ `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED=true`: setting this to `false` allows the access of
  all non-authentication-related routes without providing a (media) token,
  effectively making the API open for anyone to access. This does not disable
  authentication-related routes altogether, it merely makes authentication
  optional.
+ `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH=16`: sets the minimum password length when creating or
  updating users. Providing a higher value than `1024` will discard the value
  and use `1024` as the minimum length instead.
+ `FILES_PER_PAGE=42`: the results per page when listing files.
+ `TAGS_PER_PAGE=42`: the results per page when listing tags.
+ `AUTOCOMPLETE_LIMIT=10`: the maximum amount of tag completion results.
+ `COUNTS_ENABLED=false`: enables the output of total counts when listing files
  and tags for the cost of response times (especially with larger databases).
+ `COUNTS_CACHING_ENABLED=false`: setting this to `true` enables the caching of
  file/tag counts (only relevant when `COUNTS_ENABLED` is `true`). This is
  recommended for larger databases to decrease response times when queries are
  made that only differ in page and sorting since the count will only need to
  be calculated once (for the first query). On smaller databases, the
  performance gain might not be noticeable (or it might even be slighty slower
  for very fast queries). The cache is emptied when hydrusrv-sync runs.
+ `ACCESS_LOGGING_ENABLED=false`: setting this to `false` disables access
  logging when
  `NODE_ENV=production` is set.
+ `ACCESS_LOGFILE_PATH_OVERRIDE=`: overrides the default access logfile
  location (`logs/access.log`. Logging to a file is only enabled with
  `ACCESS_LOGGING_ENABLED=true` and `NODE_ENV=production`. With
  `NODE_ENV=development`, hydrusrv logs to the console instead.
  __Absolute path required.__

After you are done making adjustments, make sure `AUTHENTICATION_DB_PATH`
points to the correct location and run migrations to finish setting up the
authentication database:

```zsh
user@local:hydrusrv$ yarn migrate
```

The content database does not have any migrations since it is entirely managed
by hydrusrv-sync.

### Running the server

First of all, you have several options to start the server:

+ `yarn start-dev`: starts the server in development mode using
  [nodemon][nodemon] to watch for file changes and restarts when necessary.
+ `yarn start`: starts the server in production mode.
+ `./bin/www`: the script that is run when using both, `start-dev` and `start`.
  You can also execute it directly to start the server in production mode.

For running in production mode, you will likely want to set up both a reverse
proxy (I recommend [nginx][nginx]) and a way to autostart hydrusrv when booting
your machine (I personally use [Supervisor][supervisor]).

### Running with Docker

You can also run hydrusrv with [Docker][docker] if you want to. A
[Docker image][docker-hub] is available on Docker Hub.

See [here][hydrusrv-docker] for a [Docker Compose][docker-compose] setup that
combines hydrus server, hydrusrv and hydrusrv-sync into an easy-to-use package.

If you want to create your own setup, please take a look at the
[Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and the
[entrypoint file](.docker/docker-entrypoint.sh) to figure out how to configure
it.

### API

hydrusrv provides a REST-like API that a client can connect to to request data
from the server. Such a client could for example be a simple script that
"syncs" the media of a hydrus server installation with your local machine or an
application with a GUI that behaves like a booru (like
[hydrusrvue][hydrusrvue]).

#### General

Request and response bodies are always in JSON format (except when sending the
actual files). Single resources (e.g., a file or an actual media file) will
return an error with status code `404` when they do not exist while lists
(e.g., of tags or files) simply return an empty array when nothing is found.

#### Authentication

By default, all the routes except the base route (`/api`), the ones for
registering new users and creating tokens and the ones returning the actual
media files are protected with a token-based authentication. In order to access
these routes, a valid token must be provided via an
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

When updating or deleting users and tokens, the provided authentication token
is also used to identify which user/token(s) are to be modified/deleted.

Media files are protected with media tokens that are created alongside
authentication tokens. Such a media token must be provided as query parameter
when trying to access media files and expires alongside the authentication
token.

The requirement of (media) tokens for all non-authentication-related routes can
be disabled by setting `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED` to `false`.

#### Errors

When a resource is not available or an issue occurs, hydrusrv will return one
of several possible errors which are always in the same format:

```json5
{
  "error": <error name>
}
```

hydrusrv responds after the first error occurs so multiple errors might have to
be dealt with one after another.

#### Routes

__Note:__ The routes in this documentation _do not_ have URL-encoded characters
for improved readability. Please be aware that, depending on the client you are
using, you might have to URL-encode certain characters by yourself when sending
a request.

  parameter and everything else ascending by field `name`
+ `random`: sorts randomly

The sort direction for most fields (except `random`) can be changed via
`direction=asc` and `direction=desc`.

__Output on success:__

    {
      "name": <name of the tag>,
      "fileCount": <amount of files having the tag>
    }
    // [â€¦]
  ]
}
```

__Possible errors:__

+ `MissingTokenError`
+ `InvalidTokenError`
+ `MissingPartialTagFieldError`
+ `InvalidPartialTagFieldError`
+ `ShuttingDownError`
+ `InternalServerError`

##### Files

###### Listing files

__Route:__ `GET /<API_BASE>/files?page=<page>&tags[]=<tag>&constraints[]=<field><comparator><value>&sort=<method>&direction=<sort direction>&namespaces[]=<namespace>`

__Info:__

The `tags[]` parameter is optional and takes an arbitrary amount of tags (a
single tag per `tags[]`), each one (potentially) limiting the result set
further. You can also exclude files with certain tags from the results by
prefixing the tag you want to exclude with `-`, e.g., `-sky`. To prevent
confusion with tags that (for some reason) start with `-`, escape them with
`\`, e.g., `\-house` (this is not necessary for `-` that are not located at the
start of the tag).

The `constraints[]` parameter is also optional and takes an arbitrary amount
of so-called _constraints_. Constraints are used to filter files by their
(meta) fields and can be used alone or in combination with tags. Like with
tags, each constraint (potentially) limits the set further.

If multiple constraints for the same field are provided, those constraints are
compared in an `OR` fashion unless there are multiple `!=` constraints for the
field, in which case those are compared with `AND` (to make it possible to
exclude multiple values for the field while at the same time
including/comparing against other values).

The syntax is the following for a single constraint:

`constraints[]=<field><comparator><value>`

Where `field` has to be one of the following:

+ `id`: the file ID
+ `hash`: the SHA-256 hash of the file
+ `size`: the file size in number of bytes
+ `width`: the width of the file
+ `height`: the height of the file
+ `mime`: the MIME type of the file
+ `tags`: gets mapped to `tag_count` (the number of tags assigned to the file)
  internally, it's abbreviated for simplicity's sake

`comparator` can be one of:

+ `=`: compares if the content of the field equals the given value (supported
  by all fields)
+ `!=`: compares if the content of the field does not equal the given value
  (supported by all fields)
+ `~=`: compares if the content of the field approximately equals the given
  value (not supported by `hash` and `mime`)
+ `>`: compares if the content of the field is greater than the given value
  (not supported by `hash` and `mime`)
+ `<`: compares if the content of the field is smaller than the given value
  (not supported by `hash` and `mime`)
+ `><`: compares if the content of the field is between the two given values
  (the values are split by `,` and their order does not matter) (not supported
  by `hash` and `mime`)

And `value` can be:

+ _a positive integer or `0`_: can be used for comparing with `id`, `width`,
  `height` and `tags` when using the `=`, `!=`, `~=`, `>` or `<` comparator
+ _two positive integers or `0` split with `,`_: can be used for comparing with
  `id`, `width`, `height` and `tags` when using the `><` comparator
+ _a file size_: can be used for comparing with `size` when using the `=`, `!=`,
  `~=`, `>` or `<` comparator and has to be either a positive integer (for
  _bytes_) or a positive integer or float (with `.` as decimal point) plus a
  suffix of either `k`, `m` or `g` (for _kibibytes_, _mebibytes_ and _gibibytes_
  respectively)
+ _two file sizes split with `,`_: can be used for comparing with `size` when
  using the `><` comparator (the same rules as the ones for the single file
  size apply)
+ _a SHA-256 digest_: can be used for comparing with `hash`
+ _a MIME type in the common `<type>/<subtype>` syntax_: can be used for
  comparing with `mime`

Some examples could be:

+ `constraints[]=id!=42`
+ `constraints[]=id=84&constraints[]=id=126`
+ `constraints[]=hash=ed2c48b9f65f76f140b582b33e5415abe2037e43677952074b9158e6b5979ef4`
+ `constraints[]=size>5m`
+ `constraints[]=size><500k,2m`
+ `constraints[]=width>1000`
+ `constraints[]=height><500,1000`
+ `constraints[]=mime=image/png`
+ `constraints[]=tags<5`
+ `constraints[]=mime=image/png&constraints[]=size<5m&constraints[]=height>1000&constraints[]=tags>15`

Finally, the `sort` parameter is also optional and is used to sort the results
by a different field instead of `id` (which is the default sort method).

The available `sort` parameters are:

+ `id` (default, does not have to be provided): sorts descending by field `id`
+ `size`: sorts descending by field `size`
+ `width`: sorts descending by field `width`
+ `height`: sorts descending by field `height`
+ `mime`: sorts ascending by field `mime`
+ `tags`: sorts descending by field `tag_count`
+ `namespaces`: sorts ascending by provided namespaces first and descending by
  field `id` second
+ `random`: sorts randomly

The sort direction for most fields (except `random`) can be changed via
`direction=asc` and `direction=desc`.

If `sort=namespaces` is set, at least one namespace must be provided via
`namespaces[]=<namespace>`. This then sorts the results  by that namespace
(e.g., files with tag `creator:a` come before `creator:b` if sorted by
`creator` and the default direction).

Providing multiple namespaces to sort by is possible, the order in which they
are provided then defines the "sub sorting". E.g.,
`sort=namespace&namespaces[]=<namespaceA>&namespaces[]=<namespaceB>&namespaces[]=<namespaceC>`
causes files to be sorted by `namespaceA`, then `namespaceB`, then
`namespaceC`.

Files not having one or more of the given sort namespaces are _not_ omitted
from the results but will be sorted descending by `id` to the end of the (sub)
set.

This route returns the same data for each file as when
[viewing a file](#viewing-files) but omits the tags to reduce the response size
when dealing with possible cases where many files that each have many tags are
displayed on a single page.

__Output on success:__

    {

[mserajnik][maintainer], creator and maintainer of hydrusrv, hereby explicitly
state that hydrusrv is currently deployed on the following official
installations:

+ [https://hydrusrvue.mser.at][hydrusrvue-demo]

No other installations are in any way affiliated with or controlled by me and I
do not condone the usage of hydrusrv for publishing content that is
copyrighted and/or considered illegal in any country or place. hydrusrv is open

usage of hydrusrv that is outside of the aforementioned official installations.

## Demo

You can find a demo installation of [hydrusrvue][hydrusrvue] at
[https://hydrusrvue.mser.at][hydrusrvue-demo]. The hydrusrv API is available
under [https://hydrusrvue.mser.at/api][hydrusrvue-demo-api].

Please take note that I am running this installation using
[hydrusrv-docker][hydrusrv-docker] on a small
[Vultr Cloud Compute][vultr-cloud-compute] instance with limited performance,
bandwidth and traffic (meaning the demo could go down until the next month if
the traffic limit gets exceeded).

It contains only safe for work images tagged with `scenery` (take a look at the
[hydrusrvue screenshots][hydrusrvue-screenshots] for some examples).

Registration is enabled, so feel free to create as many users as you would
like. __Created users are deleted at 12am every day.__

If you are the creator of one or more of the images used in this demo
installation and would like to have your content removed, please
[message me](mailto:hello@mserajnik.at) or [open an issue][issues] and I will
comply with your request at once.

## Attribution

Special thanks to the user [FredericaBernkastel][frederica-bernkastel] for
providing valuable input and writing some amazing performance improvements
that makes hydrusrv far more usable, especially with larger hydrus server
databases.

A big thank you also to the [developer of hydrus network][hydrus-developer] for
putting up with my questions and encouraging me to work on this project.
